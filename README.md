Nash Equilibria Through Simulation
Author: Andrew Dai  

Overview

This project simulates repeated strategic interaction between rational agents to
illustrate the emergence of Nash equilibria.

The project supports:
- Prisoner’s Dilemma
- Stag and Hare
- Battle of the Sexes
- RPS

How to Run

From the command line:

python AndrewDaiNashEquilibriaSim.py <game_file.txt>

For example:
python AndrewDaiNashEquilibriaSim.py pd.txt

IMPORTANT: The 5 plots will appear sequentially (e.g. the 2nd one will appear after you close the first one), not all at once
